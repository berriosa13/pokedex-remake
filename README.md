## Reflection

I decided to take a stab at re-creating an older pokedex application that I created a couple years aho using older techonologies. What originally motivated me to do this is when I noticed that the hosting I setup for it (for free of course) through Heroku lost support and could no longer be hosted for freeðŸ˜”. As a portfolio project that I had hosted on my personal website I was annoyed at the fact that it wouldn't be viewable to the public anymore.
